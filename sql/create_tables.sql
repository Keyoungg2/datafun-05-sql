-- Start by deleting any tables if the exist already
-- We want to be able to re-run this script as needed.
-- DROP tables in reverse order of creation 
-- DROP dependent tables (with foreign keys) first

-- Create the books table
-- Note that the books table has no foreign keys, so it is a standalone table
-- All other tables will be connected to books in someway due to it being a standalone table

-- Create the authors table 
-- Note that the authors table has a foreign key to the books table
-- This means that the authors table is dependent on the books table
