# Datafun-05-sql
In this project, we will be working with Python and SQLite to grasp a statistical inference on some data files. 

## Setting Project File up
First, we will create a virtual environment and install any exteranl libraires through the terminal. Make sure to create the .gitignore file and report that .venv and .vscode contents are not pushed to your GitHub repo.
```shell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install pandas pyarrow
py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
ni .gitignore
```

At any time you want to commit to the project, simply do the following:
```shell
git add.
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```
